#Collections Part 1 Exercises

This exercise is made up of eight coding problems. Each problem is independent of the others, and may be solved in any order.

**Note, If you find yourself stuck on a problem for longer than fifteen minutes, move onto the next, and try again later.**

Java source code has been provided for you in this repository. Please fork the repository, and import the code into a new project in your local Eclipse workspace.

The project has two Java files, Exercises.java, and ExercisesTest.java. The ExercisesTest.java contains  JUnit tests for each of the coding problems. There is no need for you to do anything with this file other than to "Run As JUnit Test" inside Eclipse. The tests will verify the correctness of your solution code.

More instructions go here.

**If you have any questions, or concerns, please see one of the instructors.**
